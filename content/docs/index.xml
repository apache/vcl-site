      <guid>https://vcl.apache.org/docs/multilingualization.html</guid>
      <description>Introduction VCL 2.3 has the first step in multilingualization by allowing the parts of the site that the basic user sees to be presented in different languages. The initial work was done and contributed by Toru Yokoyama in JIRA-485.
More work will be done in future releases to add multilingualization to all parts of the site. Also, there are currently several sections where a paragraph may be translated in portions instead of as a whole.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites for your LDAP server:  enable SSL on your LDAP server Create an account that can look up a user&amp;rsquo;s first and last names, user id, and email address (email address is optional) - this will be referred to as &amp;lsquo;vcllookup&amp;rsquo; on this page. You can skip this step if anonymous binds are enabled on your LDAP server and an anonymous bind will be able to look up userids, names, and email addresses.</description>

      <description>Local VCL accounts are contained within the VCL database. The admin account is a local VCL account. Additional local accounts can be added after the backend management node component has been installed by executing the vcld file with the -setup argument:
/usr/local/vcl/bin/vcld --setup It is safe to run vcld --setup while the normal vcld daemon process is running on a management node. Running vcld --setup will not affect it.  You will see a menu.</description>

      <description>This is how I added support for partimage/partimage-ng to xCAT 2.x
Overview The method I used was based on a suggestion by Egan Ford. I created an xCAT plugin to handle the imaging commands. That plugin sets the node to boot a stateless image and configures a certain postscript to run that handles the image capture/restore.
partimageng.pm xCAT plugin First, I created an xCAT plugin to handle 2 nodeset commands for os type image: install and image.</description>

This guide will discuss adding support to VCL for kickstart based or diskfull installs.
Prerequisites are that you need to have a working xCAT install. Please see xCAT installation guide in order to install and configure xCAT.</description>

      <guid>https://vcl.apache.org/docs/advanced-image-options.html</guid>
      <description>There are several advanced options for each image that can be modified. Normally, they can be left alone. However, there are times where it is useful to set them. These are the advanced options and their descriptions. They are listed in the same order they appear on the Edit Image page.
The following advanced options are compared directly to corresponding computer attributes of the VCL computers. Configuring these fields restricts which computers can be assigned to run the image based on computer specs.</description>

      <description>Overview A connect method is the software used to connect to a reserved node.
Before 2.3, there were only a few, fixed connect methods used - RDP for Windows and ssh for Linux. In 2.3, the first stage of configurable connect methods was introduced. Potentially any connect method can now be configured for an image. For stage one, VCL admins must manually add available connect methods to the VCL database. Stage two will provide a way for available connect methods to be managed through the VCL web site.</description>

      <description>Email messages sent out to VCL users can be customized under the Site Configuration part of the site. However, HTML content is not allowed to be entered via the web form for security reasons. VCL 2.5.1 introduced a method of including HTML content in the email messages using a command line script run from a management node. The script is in the bin directory of the management node code. The same substitution available in plain text messages can be used in the HTML messages.</description>

      <description>If you are using standalone VMWare servers (i.e. ones that VCL did not deploy using xCAT), you first need to add the VMWare servers; then, you need to add the virtual machines. You can either add them individually (Adding Individual VMWare Servers/Virtual Machines), or if they have sequential hostnames and IP addresses, you can add them all at once (Adding Multiple VMWare Servers/Virtual Machines).
Once you have added at least one computer, you can get to the &amp;ldquo;Add Single Computer&amp;rdquo; page by going to Manage Computers-&amp;gt;Edit Computer Information and clicking Add.</description>

      <description>You can initially add individual computers or multiple computers all together. After you have added at least one computer, you will need to go to Manage Computers -&amp;gt; Edit Computer Information to additional ones.

Adding Individual Computers  click &amp;ldquo;Manage Computers&amp;rdquo; select the &amp;ldquo;Add Single Computer&amp;rdquo; radio button click Submit fill in Hostname, IP Address, owner (admin@Local), RAM, Proc Speed, Network Speed, select &amp;ldquo;blade&amp;rdquo; for Type, select &amp;ldquo;xCAT 2.x Provisioning&amp;rdquo;	for &amp;ldquo;Provisioning Engine&amp;rdquo;, and click the checkbox under &amp;ldquo;allcomputers&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;newimages&amp;rdquo; click Confirm Computer click Submit (don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the fact that the computer you just added isn&amp;rsquo;t listed after clicking Submit) after you&amp;rsquo;ve configured your image library and your management node has started checking in, you should be able to make a reservation</description>

      <description>Overview Once you have created a new image, there are a few things you have to do to allow other people to use it. If you don&amp;rsquo;t have access to do any of the following steps, you will need to get a VCL administrator to do them for you.
When you create a new image, it is only available to you, and it is only allowed to be run on a few computers that have been set aside for the testing of new images.</description>

      <description>After VCL is installed, you need to create images for users. As part of the installation, you should have created some base images from which to start building other images. The guides on this page explain how to create new images through the VCL, starting from already created base images.

Mount the Installation Media
The Windows installation media needs to be mounted as a drive on the computer. The method to do this varies widely based on the provisioning engine being used and resources available. The following lists some ways to mount the installation media:

Authenticating your users to VCL via LDAP allows you to use your enterprise managed accounts to log in to the VCL web site. Additionally, you can mirror certain user groups from your LDAP system into VCL so that you do not need to manage the user group memberships both in your enterprise system and in VCL.</description>

      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://vcl.apache.org/docs/shibauth.html</guid>
      <description>The VCL is designed to support Shibboleth authentication for one or more affiliations. Using Shibboleth does not preclude the use of LDAP for other affiliations in the same VCL infrastructure. The principal advantage of using Shibboleth with the VCL is the ability to completely externalize authentication (and, to a certain degree, authorization) decisions. That is, by using Shibboleth authentication, a user&amp;rsquo;s password will never pass through the VCL system.
Configure Apache The first step is to configure Apache by protecting the /shibauth directory on your webserver.</description>

There are many variables that can be substituted into the messages by the backend before a message is sent to a user. Variables are included in square brackets ( [ ] ). For example:
Your reservation for [image_name] is now available.  The list of variables that can be substituted is quite large.</description>

Understanding Image Revisions Each VCL image can have multiple revisions. When a VCL image is saved, all data from the image&amp;rsquo;s disk is saved in disk image files. A revision is still a full set of disk image files, but information about each revision allows them to be tracked as a series of updates to a VCL image.</description>
