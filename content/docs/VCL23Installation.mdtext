[TOC]

# Install & Configure the Database # {#database}

VCL currently supports the use of mysql database.

1. Download and Extract the Apache VCL Source
    * If you have not already done so, download and the Apache VCL source to the database server:

            :::BashLexer
            wget http://www.apache.org/dist/vcl/apache-VCL-2.3.tar.bz2

    * Extract the files:

            :::BashLexer
            tar -jxvf apache-VCL-2.3.tar.bz2

2. Install MySQL Server

    * Install MySQL Server 5.x
        
            :::BashLexer
            yum install mysql-server -y

    * Configure the MySQL daemon (mysqld) to start automatically:

            :::BashLexer
            /sbin/chkconfig --level 345 mysqld on

    *  Start the MySQL daemon:
        
            :::BashLexer
            /sbin/service mysqld start

    *  If the iptables firewall is being used and the web server and management nodes will be on different machines, port 3306 should be opened up. Add the following to your iptables config and restart iptables service. Note insert your web server and management node IP address in the right locations.

            :::BashLexer
            vi /etc/sysconfig/iptables
            -A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -s <web server IP> -p tcp --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT
            -A RH-Firewall-1-INPUT -m state --state NEW -s <management node IP> -p tcp --dport 3306 -j ACCEPT
            service iptables restart   

3. Create the VCL Database
   
    * Run the MySQL command-line client:
         
            :::BashLexer
            mysql

    * Create a database:
         
            :::MySqlLexer
            CREATE DATABASE vcl;

    * Create a user with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES privileges on the database you just created:
        
            :::MySqlLexer
            GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES ON vcl.* TO '**vcluser**'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '**vcluserpassword**';

    * Exit the MySQL command-line client

            :::MySqlLexer
            exit

    * Import the vcl.sql file into the database. The **vcl.sql** file is included in the **mysql** directory within the Apache VCL source code

            :::BashLexer
            mysql vcl < apache-VCL-2.3/mysql/vcl.sql

# Install & Configure the Management Node Components # {#managementnode}

**Prerequisites**
The following management node installation instructions assume the instructions on the following pages have previously been completed:

    * VCL 2.3 Database Installation
    * VCL 2.3 Web Code Installation

**Supported Operating Systems:**

The VCL management node daemon (vcld) has been developed to run on an operating system based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It has been tested on the following:

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4.x
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.x
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.x
* CentOS 5.x
* CentOS 6.x

**Required Linux Packages:**

The VCL management node daemon (vcld) requires the following Linux packages and Perl modules in order to run (see step 2 below for installation instructions):

* expat - A library for parsing XML
* expat-devel - Libraries and include files to develop XML applications with expat
* gcc - Various compilers (C, C++, Objective-C, Java, ...)
* krb5-libs - The shared libraries used by Kerberos 5
* krb5-devel - Development files needed to compile Kerberos 5 programs
* libxml2 - Library providing XML and HTML support
* libxml2-devel - Libraries, includes, etc. to develop XML and HTML applications
* mysql - MySQL client programs and shared libraries
* nmap - Network exploration tool and security scanner
* openssh - The OpenSSH implementation of SSH protocol versions 1 and 2
* openssl - The OpenSSL toolkit
* openssl-devel - Files for development of applications which will use OpenSSL
* perl - The Perl programming language
* perl-DBD-MySQL - A MySQL interface for perl
* xmlsec1-openssl - OpenSSL crypto plugin for XML Security Library

**Required Perl Modules:**

The VCL management node daemon (vcld) is written in Perl and has been tested on Perl 5.8.x. The following Perl modules available from CPAN are also required (see step 2 below for installation instructions):

* DBI - Generic Database Interface
* Digest::SHA1 - NIST SHA message digest algorithm
* Mail::Mailer - Simple mail agent interface
* Object::InsideOut - Comprehensive inside-out object support
* RPC::XML - A set of classes for core data, message and XML handling
* YAML - YAML Ain't Markup Language

1. **Install the VCL Management Node Code - Perl Daemon**

    * If you have not already done so, download and extract the source files on the web server:

            :::BashLexer
            wget http://www.apache.org/dist/vcl/apache-VCL-2.3.tar.bz2
            tar -jxvf apache-VCL-2.3.tar.bz2

    * Copy the managementnode directory to the location where you want it to reside (typically /usr/local):

            :::BashLexer
            cp -r apache-VCL-2.3/managementnode /usr/local/vcl

2. Install the Required Linux Packages & Perl Modules

    * Run the install_perl_libs.pl script located in the bin directory:

            :::BashLexer
            perl /usr/local/vcl/bin/install_perl_libs.pl

    The last line of the install_perl_libs.pl script output should be:
    
    *COMPLETE: installed all components*
    
    Note: The script will hang or terminate if it encounters a problem. If this occurs, you will need to troubleshoot the problem by looking at the output. 

    The install_perl_libs.pl script included in the VCL distribution will attempt to download and install the required Linux packages and Perl modules. It uses the yum utility to install the required Linux packages. The required Perl modules are available from CPAN - The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network. The install_perl_libs.pl script attempts to download and install the required Perl modules by using the CPAN.pm module which is included with most Perl distributions. 

    The yum utility should exist on any modern Red Hat-based Linux distribution (Red Hat, CentOS, Fedora, etc). If yum isn't available on your management node OS, you will need to download and install the required Linux packages manually or by using another package management utility. After installing the required Linux packages, attempt to run the install_perl_libs.pl script again.

3. **Configure vcld.conf**

    * Create the /etc/vcl directory:

            :::BashLexer
            mkdir /etc/vcl

    * Copy the stock vcld.conf file to /etc/vcl:
	
            :::BashLexer
            cp /usr/local/vcl/etc/vcl/vcld.conf /etc/vcl

    * Edit /etc/vcl/vcld.conf:
	
            :::BashLexer
            vi /etc/vcl/vcld.conf
            The following lines must be configured in order to start the VCL daemon (vcld) and allow it to check in to the database:
            * FQDN - the fully qualified name of the management node, this should match the name that was configured for the management node in the database
            * server - the IP address or FQDN of the database server
            * LockerWrtUser - database user account with write privileges
            * wrtPass - database user password
            * xmlrpc_pass - password for xmlrpc api from vcld to the web interface(can be long). This will be used later to sync the database vclsystem user account
            * xmlrpc_url - URL for xmlrpc api https://my.server.org/vcl/index.php?mode=xmlrpccall

    * Save the vcld.conf file

4. **Configure the SSH Client**

The SSH client on the management node should be configured to prevent SSH processes spawned by the root user to the computers it controls from hanging because of missing or different entries in the known_hosts file. 

Edit the ssh_config file:

	vi /etc/ssh/ssh_config
Set the following parameters:<br>
UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null<br>
StrictHostKeyChecking no<br>
*Note: If you do not want these settings applied universally on the management node the SSH configuration can also be configured to only apply these settings to certain hosts or only for the root user. Consult the SSH documentation for more information.*

5. **Install and Start the VCL Daemon (vcld) Service**

    * Copy the vcld service script to /etc/init.d and name it vcld:
	
            :::BashLexer
            cp /usr/local/vcl/bin/S99vcld.linux /etc/init.d/vcld

    * Add the vcld service using chkconfig:
	
            :::BashLexer
            /sbin/chkconfig --add vcld

    * Configure the vcld service to automatically run at runtime levels 3-5:
	
            :::BashLexer
            /sbin/chkconfig --level 345 vcld on

    * Start the vcld service:
	
            :::BashLexer
            /sbin/service vcld start

    * Check the vcld service by monitoring the vcld.log file:

            :::BashLexer
            tail -f /var/log/vcld.log

You should see the following being added to the log file every few seconds if the management node is checking in with the database:<br>
2012-05-15 13:23:45|25494|vcld:main(167)|lastcheckin time updated for management node 1: 2012-05-15 13:23:45


6. **Set the vclsystem account password for xmlrpc api**

Using the vcld -setup tool, set the vclsystem account. This is needed to properly use the block allocation features.
	
            :::BashLexer
            /usr/local/vcl/bin/vcld -setup

Select 1. VCL Base Module<br>
Select 2. Set Local VCL User Account Password<br>
Select 2. vclsystem<br> 
From the vcld.conf file, paste or type the password from xmlrpc_pass variable and hit enter. 
 

7. **Install & Configure the DHCP Service**

    * Install dhcp if it is not already installed:
	
            :::BashLexer
            yum install dhcp -y

    * Configure the dhcpd service to automatically start at runlevels 3-5:

            :::BashLexer
            /sbin/chkconfig --level 345 dhcpd on

    * Configure the dhcpd.conf file.
	
            :::BashLexer
            vi /etc/dhcpd.conf
            Configure your dhcpd.conf file according to your network configuration. The contents of the dhcpd.conf file will vary based on how your network is configured. Below is an example of a basic dhcpd.conf file:
  

    * Start the dhcpd service:

            :::BashLexer
            /sbin/service dhcpd start
