    <h1 class="title">2009-11 Incubator VCL Report</h1>
    
	<p>VCL has been incubating since December 2008. VCL is a cloud
computing platform for the management of physical and virtual machines.</p>
<h3 id="community-involvement">Community Involvement</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Apache VCL community is growing and people from several organizations
are contributing</li>
<li>Questions about administration and end user use of Apache VCL are
being asked and answered on the project&rsquo;s vcl-dev and vcl-user lists</li>
<li>A growing number of community members from multiple organizations are
answering questions</li>
<li>Collaboration is occurring for architectural design and release planning
via the vcl-dev list</li>
<li>Code patches have been discussed on the vcl-dev list and submitted to
the Jira issue tracking system</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="release-preparation---apache-vcl-21">Release Preparation - Apache VCL 2.1</h3>
<ul>
<li>The community is working to complete the final administrative tasks
required to issue the first release (Apache VCL 2.1)</li>
<li>Josh Thompson has volunteered to act as the release manager for 2.1
per the advice of Matt Hogstrom, one of the project mentors</li>
<li>PGP keys have been created and added to the distribution area</li>
<li>A release candidate artifact has been created and is currently being
discussed</li>
<li>Code and documentation updates are being made to the release candidate
per community consensus</li>
<li>The tasks required to complete the release are being discussed on the
vcl-dev list</li>
<li>Jira is being used to track the release tasks and to assemble the release
changelog</li>
<li>Release procedures are being documented as the community develops its
release process</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="3rd-party-dependencies">3rd Party Dependencies</h3>
<ul>
<li>Procedures for handling 3rd party dependencies are being worked out by
the VCL community with help from the ASF legal-discuss list</li>
<li>Major components of VCL are written in Perl and the Apache VCL release
will only contain Perl code developed by the ASF</li>
<li>A Perl interpreter and supplemental Perl modules are required.
These are licensed under the Artistic License, GPL, and LGPL.</li>
<li>Concerns were brought up by the project mentors and a question was posed
to the legal-discuss list. The question was answered and we are
working on implementing the recommendation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="project-name">Project Name</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Apache VCL project name issue has been resolved</li>
<li>NCSU has taken steps to clearly indicate on its Apache VCL instance
website that Apache VCL is developed by the ASF</li>
<li>References to NCSU have been removed from the code</li>
<li>NCSU employees affiliated with the Apache VCL
project routinely communicate that VCL is an ASF
project and encourage colleagues of other organizations to do the same</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>A large amount of documentation has been added to the project&rsquo;s
Confluence site</li>
<li>People from multiple organizations have contributed to improving the
documentation, both by editing the pages themselves and by pointing out
areas for improvement on the lists</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="unresolved-issues">Unresolved Issues</h3>
<ul>
<li>As noted in the May 2009 report &ndash; questions were asked of the mentors
regarding the rules governing wiki contributions from individuals who have
not signed the CLA. It is the community&rsquo;s understanding that a separate
wiki will be needed &ndash; one for official documentation included with
releases and one containing contributions from individual who have not
signed the CLA. A request has been made to one of the
mentors who had offered to create a 2nd wiki instance. This has
not been completed yet.</li>
<li>A request has been made to the mentors to create a Confluence committers
group that contains the Apache VCL community members with a CLA on file</li>
<li>A request has been made to the mentors to create a Jira Committers role
that contains the Apache VCL community members with a CLA on file</li>
<li>Some committers have lost administrative access to Jira. The
project mentors have been asked to restore the permissions.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="top-issues-before-graduation">Top Issues Before Graduation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Complete the release of Apache VCL 2.1</li>
<li>Continue to increase contributors from multiple institutions</li>
</ul>
<p>Signed off by mentor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alan Cabrera, Kevan Miller</li>
</ul>
