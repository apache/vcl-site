      <description>Using Apache Derby Database **NOTE: The current code in the trunk does not support Derby (21 Aug 2009)**
Prerequisites You should have installed:
 JDK (it is maybe possible to work with jre only)  Downloading and Setting Up the Database for VCL   Download Apache Derby and install it.
cd ~ wget http://apache.g5searchmarketing.com/db/derby/db-derby-10.5.1.1/db-derby-10.5.1.1-bin.tar.gz tar -xzf db-derby-10.5.1.1-bin.tar.gz mkdir /opt/Apache mv db-derby-10.5.1.1-bin /opt/Apache/derby export DERBY_HOME=&amp;#34;/opt/Apache/derby&amp;#34; export CLASSPATH=&amp;#34;${DERBY_HOME}/lib/derby.jar:${DERBY_HOME}/lib/derbytools.jar:${CLASSPATH}&amp;#34; PATH=&amp;#34;$DERBY_HOME/bin:$PATH&amp;#34;   Create a database in Apache Derby.</description>

      <guid>https://vcl.apache.org/comm/commprojects/automated-installation-of-vcl.html</guid>
      <description>I developed a set of scripts to automate the installation of VCL for my own purposes. I used the scripts in an advanced Linux class I taught at NCA&amp;amp;T as an example of scripting. Several student teams installed VCL on their individual servers, and the installation had to be repeated after the students experimented with the setup. The script made installation relatively quick and always consistent. The installation is basically one click.</description>
