      <description>This is how I added support for partimage/partimage-ng to xCAT 2.x
Overview The method I used was based on a suggestion by Egan Ford. I created an xCAT plugin to handle the imaging commands. That plugin sets the node to boot a stateless image and configures a certain postscript to run that handles the image capture/restore.
partimageng.pm xCAT plugin First, I created an xCAT plugin to handle 2 nodeset commands for os type image: install and image.</description>

      <description>I developed a set of scripts to automate the installation of VCL for my own purposes. I used the scripts in an advanced Linux class I taught at NCA&amp;amp;T as an example of scripting. Several student teams installed VCL on their individual servers, and the installation had to be repeated after the students experimented with the setup. The script made installation relatively quick and always consistent. The installation is basically one click.</description>

      <description>Overview A connect method is the software used to connect to a reserved node.
Before 2.3, there were only a few, fixed connect methods used - RDP for Windows and ssh for Linux. In 2.3, the first stage of configurable connect methods was introduced. Potentially any connect method can now be configured for an image. For stage one, VCL admins must manually add available connect methods to the VCL database. Stage two will provide a way for available connect methods to be managed through the VCL web site.</description>

      <description>Email messages sent out to VCL users can be customized under the Site Configuration part of the site. However, HTML content is not allowed to be entered via the web form for security reasons. VCL 2.5.1 introduced a method of including HTML content in the email messages using a command line script run from a management node. The script is in the bin directory of the management node code. The same substitution available in plain text messages can be used in the HTML messages.</description>

      <description>There are several concepts you need to understand when administering VCL.
{toc:outline=true|style=none}

Resources VCL manages sets of resources. There are four types of resources: images, computers, management nodes, and schedules. Each of these resources types are described below.

Images/Environments An image is a collection of software that is installed on an operating system. For the most part, these images can be deployed, used, modified, and saved (captured). However, there are some cases where only some of the operations could be proformed on an image.</description>

      <description>If you are using standalone VMWare servers (i.e. ones that VCL did not deploy using xCAT), you first need to add the VMWare servers; then, you need to add the virtual machines. You can either add them individually (Adding Individual VMWare Servers/Virtual Machines), or if they have sequential hostnames and IP addresses, you can add them all at once (Adding Multiple VMWare Servers/Virtual Machines).
Once you have added at least one computer, you can get to the &amp;ldquo;Add Single Computer&amp;rdquo; page by going to Manage Computers-&amp;gt;Edit Computer Information and clicking Add.</description>

      <description>You can initially add individual computers or multiple computers all together. After you have added at least one computer, you will need to go to Manage Computers -&amp;gt; Edit Computer Information to additional ones.

Adding Individual Computers  click &amp;ldquo;Manage Computers&amp;rdquo; select the &amp;ldquo;Add Single Computer&amp;rdquo; radio button click Submit fill in Hostname, IP Address, owner (admin@Local), RAM, Proc Speed, Network Speed, select &amp;ldquo;blade&amp;rdquo; for Type, select &amp;ldquo;xCAT 2.x Provisioning&amp;rdquo;	for &amp;ldquo;Provisioning Engine&amp;rdquo;, and click the checkbox under &amp;ldquo;allcomputers&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;newimages&amp;rdquo; click Confirm Computer click Submit (don&amp;rsquo;t worry about the fact that the computer you just added isn&amp;rsquo;t listed after clicking Submit) after you&amp;rsquo;ve configured your image library and your management node has started checking in, you should be able to make a reservation</description>

      <description>These are some guidelines for making a large contribution to Apache VCL for people who are not currently committers.
 State on the vcl-dev list what modification you&amp;rsquo;d like to make. Some background on why the existing codebase doesn&amp;rsquo;t work in your situation would be useful. Remember, when you modify existing code, it affects work being done by other contributors, which can result in imposing additional work on them. Propose a plan on the vcl-dev list for making the modification.</description>

      <description>Modularization Example The following diagram shows how the image capture sequence differs if different provisioning modules are used &amp;ndash; xCAT and VMWare.
Take note of the following:
 The calls made by image.pm to the xCAT and VMWare capture() subroutines are identical. The image.pm state module does not care which provisioning engine is being used. All it knows is that a provisioning engine object has been created before image.pm::process() was called, the object can be accessed via $self-&amp;gt;provisioner, and the name of the subroutine to call is capture().</description>

Authenticating your users to VCL via LDAP allows you to use your enterprise managed accounts to log in to the VCL web site. Additionally, you can mirror certain user groups from your LDAP system into VCL so that you do not need to manage the user group memberships both in your enterprise system and in VCL.</description>

      <description>managegroups.py is a script for remotely managing VCL user groups. It uses VCL&amp;rsquo;s XML RPC API to provide an easy command line driven way of doing group management.
{color:#ff0000}{}NOTE: This script does not work with python 2.7. It relies on the xmlrpclib module which changed from 2.6 to 2.7 in a way that broke the script. You need to use python 2.6 for it to work.{color}

      <description>Background The VCL backend code was significantly reworked in version 2.0 toÂ utilize aÂ &amp;ldquo;modularized&amp;rdquo; framework.Â This framework allows certain parts of the code to be separated from the core code through the implementation of modules.
VCL interacts with external technologies including:
 provisioning engines operating systems monitoring utilities  The technology being used may vary based on the VCL deployment, management node, image, computer, and so on.Â Modules make configuring VCL to use a certain technology easy while simplifying the core code.</description>

      <description>For the current Apache VCL release (version 2.2.1), the system requires a minimum of two parallel networks, i.e.: (1) A private network, providing interconnectivity between the VCL management node and the deployed target server(s) (the latter with the requested software being provided to the end user, running either real or virtual images). This private network allows the management node to manage the pool of server resources, and to load and tear down the images (OS plus applications/middleware) on the target server(s) that will be handed to an end user.</description>

      <description>Baseline VCL security for the end-user environments:
 The VCL environments are not generally shared. One user to one machine. After an environment is used - the machine is reloaded(sanitized) with the same or another golden environment. All residual data is destroyed or overwritten during the reload process. Images can be setup to allow the user to have either administrative access or unprivileged access by using the image profile meta-data. This is on a per image basis.</description>

      <title>Shibboleth Authentication</title>
      <link>https://vcl.apache.org/docs/shibauth.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://vcl.apache.org/docs/shibauth.html</guid>
      <description>The VCL is designed to support Shibboleth authentication for one or more affiliations. Using Shibboleth does not preclude the use of LDAP for other affiliations in the same VCL infrastructure. The principal advantage of using Shibboleth with the VCL is the ability to completely externalize authentication (and, to a certain degree, authorization) decisions. That is, by using Shibboleth authentication, a user&amp;rsquo;s password will never pass through the VCL system.
Configure Apache The first step is to configure Apache by protecting the /shibauth directory on your webserver.</description>

      <description>Message Substitutions Messages sent to users and admins can be configured via the VCL web site under Site Configuration as of version 2.5. There are many variables that can be substituted into the messages by the backend before a message is sent to a user. Variables are included in square brackets ( [ ] ). For example:
Your reservation for [image_name] is now available.  The list of variables that can be substituted is quite large.</description>

      <description>Something VCL has been lacking is automated management of storage, both on the system side and on the user side. This is a list of areas that should be addressed when designing storage management and automation:
 System storage: ** block attached image store for management nodes ** network attached image store for management nodes ** block attached image store for hypervisors ** network attached image store for hypervisors ** block attached images for node booting (i.</description>

      <description>Sysprep may fail if mass storage drivers are not signed.Â This problem occurs even if the sysprep.inf file is configured with DriverSigningPolicy=Ignore.Â This is a known problem with some versions of LSI SAS drivers (1.30.02.00) used on IBM blades.Â The driver available fromÂ LSI&amp;rsquo;s websiteÂ is not correctly signed. The same version is available from IBM&amp;rsquo;s websiteÂ and is correctly signed. It can be downloaded from: (Critical update) IBM and LSI Basic or Integrated RAID SAS driver v1.</description>

      <description>This is a continuation of other pages, if you did not come from Save the Image , you should start at Creating a New Image from a Base Image .

Understanding Image Revisions Each VCL image can have multiple revisions. When a VCL image is saved, all data from the image&amp;rsquo;s disk is saved in disk image files. A revision is still a full set of disk image files, but information about each revision allows them to be tracked as a series of updates to a VCL image.</description>

      <guid>https://vcl.apache.org/confluence_export/lab.pm-provisioning-module.html</guid>
      <description>The Lab.pm provisioning module is used to broker access to standalone pre-installed Linux or Solaris machines. These machines could be in an existing walk-in computer lab or racked in a server room.
There are four main parts needed to setup a standalone machine to use with the Lab.pm module.
 a non-root account called vclstaff on the target machines ssh idenitity key for vclstaff account, this key is used by the vcld process on the management node ssh service running on port 24 of the target machines vclclientd running on the target machines, vclclientd in the bin directory of the vcld release  For distribution to a large set of machines, an rpm or package could be created to distribute vclclientd and related files.</description>

      <guid>https://vcl.apache.org/confluence_export/variable-table.html</guid>
      <description>Overview This page describes the variable table in the database.Â The purpose of this table is to allow pieces of data to be easily stored in the databaseÂ without having toÂ manipulate the schema.Â The need for such a table has grown over time as more and more features are added to VCL.Â This table will become very useful as VCL becomes increasingly modularized.Â This table will allow any VCL component to access the variable data without having to interact directly with the database.</description>

You can either add them individually (Adding Individual VMWare Servers/Virtual Machines), or if they have sequential hostnames and IP addresses, you can add them all at once (Adding Multiple VMWare Servers/Virtual Machines).
Once you have added at least one computer, you can get to the &amp;ldquo;Add Single Computer&amp;rdquo; page by going to Manage Computers-&amp;gt;Edit Computer Information and clicking Add.</description>

      <description>The hostname in an SSL certificate used for LDAP must match the hostname entered in the conf.php file (this is the SSL certificate actually installed on the LDAP server, not the CA certificate). If you have no control over making it match, you can just put an entry in /etc/hosts with the IP of the LDAP server and the hostname that is in the certificate. To view the hostname in the certificate, you need a file containing the certificate (mycert.</description>

      <description>VCL stands for Virtual Computing Lab. It is a free &amp;amp; open-source cloud computing platform with the primary goal of delivering dedicated, custom compute environments to users.
This compute environments can range from something as simple as a virtual machine running productivity software to a cluster of powerful physical servers running complex HPC simulations.
VCL supports provisioning several different types of compute resources including physical bare-metal machines, virtual machines hosted on several different hypervisors, and traditional computing lab computers you would normally find on a university campus.</description>
