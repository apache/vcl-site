### DESCRIPTION

VCL is a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and
brokers remote access to compute resources including virtual machines,
bare-metal computers, and resources in other cloud platforms. A
self-service web portal is used to request resources and for
administration. VCL became a TLP on June 20, 2012.

### CURRENT ACTIVITY
* Work continues to migrate content from Confluence to the new CMS website
and to improve the design.
* VCL 2.3.1 will likely be released before the December 2012 board meeting.
This is a bug fix release. All of the issues targeted for VCL 2.3.1 have
been resolved and the release process is beginning.
* Most development has been devoted to addressing bugs in VCL 2.3 and
preparing VCL 2.3.1. Work on new features slated for VCL 2.4 will increase
now that VCL 2.3.1 is complete.
* Alan Cabrera and Kevan Miller have resigned from the VCL PMC. They were
mentors of the VCL project throughout incubation. The VCL community is
grateful for all of their help.
