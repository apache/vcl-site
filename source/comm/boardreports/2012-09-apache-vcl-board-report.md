### DESCRIPTION

VCL is a modular cloud computing platform which dynamically provisions and
brokers remote access to compute resources including virtual machines,
bare-metal computers, and resources in other cloud platforms. A
self-service web portal is used to request resources and for
administration. VCL became a TLP on June 20, 2012.

### CURRENT ACTIVITY
* The community has completed the post-graduation tasks.
* Work continues to migrate content from Confluence to the new CMS website
and to improve the design.
* Several commits have been made to the VCL 2.3.1 bugfix branch to address
minor problems with VCL 2.3, which was released in July. VCL 2.3.1 will be
released this fall.
* Traffic on the lists has been fairly high, mostly due to questions
related to recently released VCL 2.3.
* Development is still in the beginning stage for the VCL 2.4 features. 
Most development has been devoted to bug fixes.
* One of the committers is working to develop code to provide a VCL block
in Moodle. Some licensing concerns arose from this due to Moodle's GPL
license. [\[1\]](#1)
 Guidance was provided by legal-discuss. It was decided for this to be a
separate non-ASF project independent of the Apache VCL.
