title: 2010-02 Incubator VCL Report
---

VCL has been incubating since December 2008. VCL is a cloud computing
platform for the management of physical and virtual machines.

### Community Involvement
* The Apache VCL community continues to grow. We're seeing more and more
people start to contribute to our online documentation and file JIRA issues
- some with patches attached.
* We're seeing more feature requests come in which means more people are
using VCL.
* More people have joined the vcl-dev list and are asking questions as they
install VCL at new locations.
* Aaron Peeler, Andy Kurth, and Josh Thompson have become part of the PPMC.

### First Official Release
* Our first official release (Apache VCL 2.1) was made available on Dec.
4th, 2009.
* We set a small number of features to work on for the next few releases in
hopes of getting releases out more quickly.

### 3rd Party Dependencies
Procedures for handling 3rd party dependencies have been worked out. All
dependencies that have incompatible licenses are now specified as "System
Requirements" as stated under "System Requirements" at [http://www.apache.org/legal/3party.html](http://www.apache.org/legal/3party.html)

### Documentation
* A large amount of documentation has been added to the project's
Confluence site
* People from multiple organizations have contributed to improving the
documentation, both by editing the pages themselves and by pointing out
areas for improvement on the lists
* A new confluence space has been created to be used for managing the
official documentation for the project. Documentation that should be
included with releases will be migrated from the existing confluence space
to the new one, and the autoexport of the space will be cron copied to our
official documentation location. Work on this migration has not started.

### Unresolved Issues
All unresolved issues reported in our 2009-11 report have been resolved.

### Top Issues Before Graduation
* Continue to increase contributors from multiple institutions
