VCL has been incubating since December 2008. VCL is a cloud computing
platform for the management of physical and virtual machines.

### New Committers

* The Apache VCL community recently added Aaron Coburn of Amherst College
as a committer. We welcome Aaron and look forward to his expertise and
knowledge to help advance VCL software.
* There are a couple of other potential committers that might be able to
join the community as committers. We look forward to hopefully bring them
aboard.

### Community Involvement

* The Apache VCL community is seeing continued growth and interest around
the world.
* The community activity on the mailing list is an open
discussion and members respectfully exchange ideas and provide support.

### Releases
* Our next release is behind our intended schedule, we are working through
the remaining issues and features. We are targeting a March Release for
Apache VCL 2.3. This will included support for Vcenter, kvm hypervisors,
server based profiles and lots of bug fixes.
Top Issues Before Graduation
* Continue to increase contributors to establish a more diverse development
community.
