title: 2010-05 Incubator VCL Report
---

VCL has been incubating since December 2008. VCL is a cloud computing
platform for the management of physical and virtual machines.

### Community Involvement
* As stated in the previous report, the Apache VCL community continues to
grow. We're seeing more and more people start to contribute to our online
documentation and file JIRA issues.
* A few people from the community have been contacted by PPMC members
encouraging them to become more involved in the project.
* We continue to see people from new locations asking questions on the
vcl-dev list which shows that interest in VCL is continuing to grow.
* Interest from the community to have support for a more recent version of
VMWare Free Server drove the decision to swap that feature (originally
slated for VCL 2.3) with cluster reservation improvements (originally
slated for VCL 2.2).

### Plans for next Release
* We hope to have our next release out by the end of June. This would be
1/2 the time it took to get our previous release out. We hope to continue
to shorten the time between releases as we move forward.

### Documentation
* Migration of official documentation to our second Confluence space has
started. The next step is to pick an autoexport template, and then set up a
cronjob to copy the autoexported content to our official documentation
location.

### Top Issues Before Graduation
* Continue to increase contributors from multiple institutions
