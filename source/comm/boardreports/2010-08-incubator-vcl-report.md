title: 2010-08 Incubator VCL Report
---

VCL has been incubating since December 2008. VCL is a cloud computing
platform for the management of physical and virtual machines.

### Community Involvement
* As stated in the previous report, the Apache VCL community continues to
grow. We're seeing more people start to contribute to our online
documentation and file JIRA issues.
* As reported in the last board report a few people from the community have
been contacted by PPMC members encouraging them to become more involved in
the project. There was positive interest from a few, they submitted iCLA's
but have yet to contribute anything for the PPMC's to review for
acceptance. 
* We see people from new locations asking questions on the vcl-dev list
which shows that interest in VCL is growing.

### Plans for next Release
* The next release has been delayed slightly to make sure all jira issues
were satisfied correctly. The new target date is to have the next release
candidate out available by the end of August 2010.

### Top Issues Before Graduation
* Continue to increase contributors from multiple institutions
