---

VCL has been incubating since December 2008. VCL is a cloud computing platform for the management of physical and virtual machines.[https://cwiki.apache.org/VCL/](https://cwiki.apache.org/VCL/)

### Community Involvement
* We are very excited to introduce a new committer, David Hutchins.
* As stated in the previous report, the Apache VCL community continues to
grow. We're seeing more people start to contribute to our online
documentation and file JIRA issues.
* We continue to see growing interest in the VCL project from a variety of
locations. Several others have submitted patches.&nbsp;

### Plans for next Release
* The next release is scheduled toward the end of&nbsp;February. This will
be a dot release (VCL 2.2.1) to fix a few bugs and add improved code for
handling virtual machines. The 2.3 release is planned for late spring.

### Top Issues Before Graduation
* Continue to increase contributors from multiple institutions.
* Discuss next steps for Graduation with mentors.
