title: 2009-01 Incubator VCL Report
---

Included is the monthly status report for VCL to the Incubator PMC for
January 2009

* Community
The community has been active on the vcl-dev mailing list.  Some new
interested parties have subscribed and open discussion about goals,
development processes, etc. have been happening.

There has been some discussion about the use of the project name VCL as NC
State is still using this name for their student computing lab.  The issue
was raised about whether this is acceptable or not.  This issue should be
resolved before the next board report.


* Source Code
Code has been committed and folks are getting accustomed to the structure
and layout of the VCL architecture.



* Miscellaneous
No issues at this time.
