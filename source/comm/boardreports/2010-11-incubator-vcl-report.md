title: 2010-11 Incubator VCL Report
---

VCL has been incubating since December 2008. VCL is a cloud computing
platform for the management of physical and virtual machines.

### Community Involvement
* The Apache VCL user community continues to grow. We really need to get
more committers. We have asked on our development list for more people to
get involved and also individually contacted people encouraging them to get
involved, but are still having trouble getting people on board.

### Plans for next Release
* We announced our second release through ASF on Oct. 5th
* We plan to reduce the number of items to go in to the next release in
hopes of decreasing time between releases.

### Top Issues Before Graduation
* Continue to increase contributors from multiple institutions
