#### Community Involvement

* Numerous Apache VCL community members have gained enough knowledge and
are actively answering questions on the mailing lists.
* Questions have been posted to the lists related to several new
installations from around the world.
* Development issues are being discussed with participants from many
different organizations.

### Code Contributions

* Support for IBM Power7 hardware was discussed on the development
list. Code and documentation was contributed by Sunil Venkatesh of
the University of Maryland Baltimore County.
* Received a contribution from Satoshi Kobayashi of Hitachi Ltd. Japan to
add Multilingualization/internationalization of the web UI and several
other improvements.
* Received a provisioning module for VMware vCenter clusters from Aaron
Coburn at Amherst college.
* Mark Gardner from Virginia Tech is working on adding support for IPv6.

### New Committers

* Several individuals from different institutions have expressed interest
in becoming committers.
* The main barrier encountered is obtaining university legal department
approval of individual and corporate contributor license agreements.
Current committers are working with interested individuals to share
experience and work through these issues.

### Top Issues Before Graduation

* Work with the individuals who have already contributed code to Apache VCL
and have expressed interest in becoming a committer. Assist them with
the process of submitting the license agreement. Complete the process
by conducting a vote on the vcl-private list.
