---

VCL has been incubating since December 2008. VCL is a cloud computing
platform for the management of physical and virtual machines. It
provides comparatively easy and simple base line install with a
end-user self service interface.

### New Committers

* The Apache VCL community recently added James O'Dell from California
State University at Fullerton as a committer. We welcome James and look
forward to his expertise and knowledge to help advance VCL project and
community.

### New PPMC member

* The Apache VCL PPMC recently added Aaron Coburn as a new PPMC member. The
current PPMC welcomes Aaron.

### Community Involvement
* The Apache VCL community is a growing community with global interest from
Education and commercial entities.
* The community is fast to respond to user questions and discuss design
ideas in a respectful manner.
* We have seen cross project interest as through a contribution of a VCL
driver to the Apache LIBCLOUD project.
* There are other potential candidates that have expressed
interest in becoming committers. They are working through their initial
contributions. We look forward to hopefully bring them aboard.

### Releases

* Our next release has been delayed from our previous board report.
* This 2.3 release is a very large release, including bug-fixes, support
from kvm, VMWare vcenter, multi-lingualization, and approved
contributions from the community.
* We are in testing now and hope to generate a 2.3 release
candidate in the next few days.

### Top Issues Before Graduation

* Graduation work itself - As a community discuss graduation to determine
if we are ready. If so proceed with starting the process.
