### Community Involvement
* As stated in the previous report, the Apache VCL community continues to
grow. We're seeing more people start to contribute to our online
documentation and file JIRA issues. We're also starting to see more patches
attached to JIRA issues.
* We continue to see growing interest in the VCL project from a variety of
locations.
* We are currently working on growing the committers for Apache VCL
project.

### Releases
* The Apache VCL 2.2.1 version was release on April 8th 2011 and addressed
bugfixes and minor improvements.
* Our next release Apache VCL 2.3 is on track and we are targeting late
fall timeframe. New features planned include support for the KVM hypervisor
which is to be contributed by the community. In addition to KVM, the
committers will address server loads, and the improvement of cluster
reservations.

### Top Issues Before Graduation
* Continue to increase contributors to establish a more diverse development
community
