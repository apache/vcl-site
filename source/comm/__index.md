## How do I Join the Project

Projects at Apache operate under a [meritocracy][11], meaning those that the developers notice participating to a high extent will be invited to join the project as a committer.

This is as much based on personality and ability to work with other developers and the community as it is with proven technical ability. Being unhelpful to other users, or obviously looking to become a committer for bragging rights and nothing else is frowned upon, as is asking to be made a committer without having contributed sufficiently to be invited.

Apache VCL has some basic [guidelines][12] on the steps to become eligible for consideration to become a Apache VCL committer.

## Board Reports
All Apache projects must submit [regular reports](/comm/boardreports/)
to the Apache Board.
