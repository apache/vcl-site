To make a VCL reservation:
1. Select *New Reservation* from the left navigation menu
1. Select the environment you would like to use from the drop-down box
1. If you would like to use the environment immediately, select *Now*.
Otherwise, select *Later* and select a time in the future to schedule use
of the environment.
1. Select the duration you would like to use the environment, or, if you
have access to and need the reservation for a really long time, enter an
end date/time in the *Until* box.
1. * The maximum time you can select for duration varies by access level.
1. * For most users (again, it depends on your access level), you can extend
the length of your reservation after you have made it by selecting *Edit*
on the *Current Reservations* page.
1. If the combination you have selected in the above elements is currently
available, the button will display *Create Reservation*.  Click it to
create your reservation. If it is not currently available, the button will
display *View Time Table* which will present you with a table of reserved
and available time slots.  Click one of the green areas to select a
different time to use the environment.
