title: Becoming a Committer

{excerpt}This page explains the process someone must go through to become
an official committer to Apache VCL.{excerpt}

There are 4 steps you need to go through to become an official committer.

1. Actively answer questions on the vcl-dev/vcl-user lists
By answering questions on the community lists, you show an interest in the
community. Your answers provide a metric of how well you understand VCL and
how the Apache VCL community works.
1. Sign an Individual Contributor License Agreement (ICLA)
To contribute any code or documentation, you must have an ICLA on file with
the Apache Software Foundation. More information about the ICLA is
available on the [licenses page](http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas)
. Once you have done this, you should express interest on the vcl-dev list
that you are interested in becoming a committer.

|Becoming a Committer#skip3] Contribute non-trivial code by attaching
patches to JIRA issues
Before being granted commit access to the code respository, you need to
demonstrate some level of understanding of the code and some level of
coding proficiency. This is done by contributing patches to JIRA issues. We
realize "non-trivial" is a subjective term, but simple one-liner patches
don't allow you to be evaluated at all. (Don't worry we need more
committers; so we're not strict!)
1. Be voted in as a new committer on the vcl-private list
There is a private VCL list for members of the Podling Project Management
Committee (PPMC) to discuss whether or not someone should be given the
rights of a committer. A formal vote must happen on this list for you to be
accepted as a committer.

Once you have been accepted, your next step is to start contributing stuff!

 If you only want to contribute documentation, you can skip step #3.
However, if you later want to start contributing code, you will still need
to go through step #3 and have a new vote in step #4 before being granted
commit access to the code repository.
