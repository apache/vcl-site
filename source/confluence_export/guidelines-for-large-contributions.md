title: Guidelines for Large Contributions
---

These are some guidelines for making a large contribution to Apache VCL for
people who are not currently committers.

1. State on the vcl-dev list what modification you'd like to make.  Some
background on why the existing codebase doesn't work in your situation
would
be useful.  Remember, when you modify existing code, it affects work being
done by other contributors, which can result in imposing additional work on
them.
1. Propose a plan on the vcl-dev list for making the modification.  There
may
be others that want the same modification or something similar that can be
incorporated at the same time.	Those people can help develop the
modification.  On the other hand, the modification may have a very negative
affect on some other part of the project.  Also, this provides an
opportunity
for existing contributors (those who know the codebase well) to provide
input
on your plan.  The plan needs to include how the modification will be
maintained in the future - will you continue to maintain it; will existing
contributors have to pick it up and maintain it?
1. Create a JIRA issue to track implementation of the plan and start
developing.  This provides a way for others to track work being done on the
modification and ensures information about the modification will be added
to
the CHANGELOG when the next release is cut.
