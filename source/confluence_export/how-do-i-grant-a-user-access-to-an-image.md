How Do I grant a user access to an Image?
The 1st step would to make sure that you have an image that you want to
access.
I would 1st go into the Mage Group and add a Resource Group Called Math.
This would be a Image Type and the Name would be Math, the owning User
group will be my AdminTeam@mycampus. A group has now been created called
Math. 
Then in your Manage Images Under Edit Image grouping.  I prefer the Check
box Grid
To the Left in the Image table these are the Images that you have created
you can either create a new Image Group or check off an image to a group.
You can also add all of your images to the same group. For example, I
created a group called Math. I am going to group my Mathmatica 7 and Maple
13 images in this Math Group. (I have already created both of these images)
Both are Math software and I will check them in the same group. You then
scroll down and hit Submit Changes.
Now will go to the Privilege Tree
I have our Privilege Tree by Department
I have my Tree Setup by Campus. I will check on my campus then Math
Department
Once I am here I can then manually add to either Users (One person at a
time) Or I can add to the User Group. We have used people soft to import
users for our Classes. For example Math_2301 has 30 users. I am going to
group the User Group Math_2301 and give them access to ImageCheckout. I
will only click on Image checkout. I just want to give them that access
only.
Move down to the Resources in the Privileges Tree
I’m going to now give it access to my VMware Vmguest Pool. I have called
our pool my campus VMguest, I am going to check on Available. This will now
make the selected Vmguest available to check out an image of my choice. The
VMguest should be in the group type computer.
I am now going to add a group type Image. This will give an image that is
available to this pool. I will then add my group name Math with the group
type Image. I will then check on available.

Once this is done. I have made my Math Image under the Math Group available
for my Math_2301 class.

Let’s say there is a student who isn’t listed in the class or a TA that
also needs access to this image.
Go to the User in the Privileges at the Selected Node, you can manually add
a user, don’t forget it needs to be there NET ID or ID @ their correct
affliction.  For example AD3421@Mycampus
