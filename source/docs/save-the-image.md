title: Save the Image
---

When you're finished configuring the remote computer and are ready to save
the image:

1. Log off of the remote VCL computer
1. From your own machine, return to the **Current Reservations** page on the
VCL website
1. Select **More Options...->End Reservation & Create Image**
1. Here you may have two options, select one of them and click **Submit**
 * **Creating New Image** - this creates a completely new image
 * **Update Existing Image** - if you are the owner of the image, you can
select this option to simply create a new revision of the image. The rest
of these steps do not apply if you use this option. See [more information about updating an existing image](updating-an-existing-image.html)
1. Enter a name for the new image. Keep it simple. It is a good idea to name
it based off of the main applications installed or how the image will be
used (i.e. if it is for a specific class, you could use the course number
as the name). The image name is displayed when a user makes a reservation
and can be changed later if needed.
1. Fill in an image description - you can explain more about the image here.
This information is displayed on the **New Reservations** page under the
drop-down box for selecting the image.
1. Optionally, fill in **Usage Notes**. If you would like to give users of the
image some instructions about how to use the image, enter them here. This
is displayed on the **Connect!** page so that users will see it right before
they connect to the image.
1. Optionally, fill in **Revision Comments**. This is just a place where you can
enter notes for yourself - end users will never see this information. You can enter 
anything here, but these are some suggestions:
 * list of applications installed
 * any special steps you had to take to get an application to install
 * if there is licensed software installed, when the license expires
 * whether or not you installed system or software updates
1. You can usually leave the [Advanced Options](advanced-image-options.html)
 alone
1. Click **Confirm Image**
1. Double check what was entered, then click **Add Image**
1. You will then be presented with an Installer Agreement. If you agree to
it, click **I agree** to start the imaging process


The imaging process takes roughly 20-25 minutes to complete. Afterward, you
should receive an email saying your image is ready for testing
(occasionally, if there is a lot of software installed in the image or if
the system is extremely busy, this can take as long as 90 minutes).
